API Resources: Consistent JSON response formatting
Eloquent Relationships: Proper model relationships and scoping
Authorization Policies: Granular permission system implementation
4. Testing Strategy (22/25)
Feature Testing: Comprehensive API endpoint coverage
Factory Pattern: Proper test data generation
Authentication Testing: Proper user context and permissions
Edge Cases: Validation and authorization failure scenarios
5. Database Design (23/25)
Migration Schema: Well-structured with proper constraints
Indexing Strategy: Performance-optimized indexes on filtered columns
Relationship Design: Proper foreign key relationships with cascading
Data Integrity: Enum constraints and validation rules
‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement (8 points deducted)
1. Missing Enterprise Patterns (-3 points)
Copy// Missing: Event/Listener pattern for goal status changes
Event::dispatch(new GoalStatusChanged($goal, $oldStatus, $newStatus));

// Missing: Observer pattern for automatic progress calculation
class GoalObserver {
    public function updated(Goal $goal) {
        if ($goal->isDirty('progress') && $goal->progress === 100) {
            $goal->status = Goal::STATUS_COMPLETED;
        }
    }
}
2. Performance Considerations (-2 points)
Copy// Missing: Query optimization hints
public function getAllPaginated(array $filters = []): LengthAwarePaginator
{
    return $this->model->newQuery()
        ->select(['id', 'name', 'status', 'progress']) // Select only needed fields
        ->with(['owner:id,name,email', 'workspace:id,name']) // Limit relationship fields
        ->when($filters['workspace_id'], fn($q, $id) => $q->where('workspace_id', $id))
        ->paginate($filters['per_page'] ?? 15);
}
3. Advanced Validation (-2 points)
Copy// Missing: Custom validation rules
class CreateGoalRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            // Missing: Custom rule for business logic
            'end_date' => [
                'nullable',
                'date',
                'after_or_equal:start_date',
                new WorkspaceGoalLimitRule($this->workspace_id) // Custom rule
            ],
        ];
    }
}
4. Caching Strategy (-1 point)
Copy// Missing: Strategic caching for frequently accessed data
public function getGoalsByWorkspace(int $workspaceId): Collection
{
    return Cache::tags(['goals', "workspace:{$workspaceId}"])
        ->remember("goals:workspace:{$workspaceId}", 3600, function () use ($workspaceId) {
            return $this->goalRepository->getByWorkspace($workspaceId, ['owner', 'tasks']);
        });
}
